Software Engineering Methodologies project - CBS1005


The ViSell project aims to develop a localized online marketplace
specifically designed for students at VIT Vellore. The platform
facilitates the buying and selling of various items such as exam
papers, notes, textbooks, reference books, stationery, and other
useful items like used mattresses and calculators. By creating a
dedicated platform for students, ViSell seeks to foster a communitydriven marketplace that simplifies transactions and enhances
resource sharing among students.

maintenance of an e-commerce platform tailored for the VIT Vellore student
community. Key components include:
